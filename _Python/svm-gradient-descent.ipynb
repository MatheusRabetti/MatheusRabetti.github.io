    "## Main ways to train a machine learning model\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three popular ways to train a model: batch learning, mini-batch learning, and stochastic learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Batch Learning :** In the first mode, we store all the training data in an array and feed it to the algorithm, reducing the loss function based on all the examples at once. This is not always possible due to the size of the dataset. In these cases we have to resort to the two other ways.\n",
    "* **Mini-Batch Learning :** In this case, we select a N number of examples and divide the training set into blocks of this size. So we train the model in one block at a time.\n",
    "* **Stochastic learning :** this is a variation of the mini-batch, but with N = 1. We use only one example at a time to train the model. This is the preferred mode in big data solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we have two main divisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Offline :** In this case we have all the data stored in a database, but it does not fit in memory, so we need to train on one example (or batch) at a time.\n",
    "* **Online :** In this case we receive the examples in real time, we train and we discard, without the need to store them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to not having to load all the data in memory to train the model, in some cases, using algorithms that train on one example at a time may be faster than the format that uses all the data at the same time.\n"

    "## Support Vector Machine - SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to classify data with machine learning. You could run a logistic regression, use decision trees, or build a neural network to accomplish the task. In 1963, Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis developed another classification tool, the support vector machine. Vapnik refined this classification method in the 1990â€™s and extended uses for SVMs. Support vector machines have become a great tool for the data scientist and is my choice in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs try to find a hyperplane, which maximizes the margin between two classes. The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and a few close points. These close points are the support vectors because they control the hyperplane.\n",

    "## Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "To start explaning from scratch a for dummy concept helps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say you are about to start a business that sells t-shirts, but you are unsure what are the best measures for a medium sized one for males. Luckily you have gathered a group of men that have all stated they tend to buy medium sized t-shirts. Now you figure you're going to use a gradient descent type method t get the size just right.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Batch Gradient Descent\n",
    "1. Tailor makes initial estimate.\n",
    "2. Each person in the batch gets to try the t-shirt and write down feedback.\n",
    "3. Collect and summarize all feedback.\n",
    "4. If the feedback suggests a change, let the tailor adjust the t-shirt and go to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "1. Tailor makes initial estimate.\n",
    "2. A random guy (or a subset of the full group) tries the t-shirt and gives feedback.\n",
    "3. Make a small adjustment according to feedback.\n",
    "4. While you still have time for this, go to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Highlighting the differences\n",
    "\n",
    "* Batch gradient descent needs to collect lots of feedback before making adjustments, but needs to do fewer adjustments.\n",
    "* Stochastic gradient descent makes many small adjustments, but spends less time collecting feedback in between.\n",
    "* Batch gradient descent preferable if the full population is small, stochastic gradient descent preferable if the full population is very large.\n",
    "* Batch gradient descent methods can be made parallel if you have access to more hardware (in this case, more tailors and materials) as you can collect all feedback in parallel.\n",
    "* Stochastic gradient descent does not readily lend itself to parallelization as the you need the feedback from one iteration to proceed with the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "A gradient is the ratio by which a variable quantity increases or decreases. The adjusments according to the feedback are this variation. The feedback can be de error function. The gradient of a scalar function is the co-vector with the direction according to which the highest rate of change of function occurs. Its modulus is equal to the rate of function variation along that direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both batch gradient descent (GD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), you update a set of parameters in an iterative manner to minimize the error function.\n",
    "\n",
    "While in GD, you have to run through **all** the samples in your training set to do a single update for a parameter in a particular iteration, in SGD, on the other hand, you use **only one** training sample from your training set to do the update for a parameter in a particular iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if the number of training samples are large, in fact very large, then using gradient descent may take too long because in every iteration when you are updating the values of the parameters, you are running through the complete training set. On the other hand, using SGD will be faster because you use only one training sample and it starts improving itself right away from the first sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "That difference explains the stochastic process, instead of describing the system through deterministic equations, that given an initial condition, we know all the evolution of the system, we will use stochastic processes, for which, given an initial condition, we still have several possible trajectories evolution of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGD minimizes a function by following the gradients of the cost function. "
