> "Generating numbers is easy, generating numbers you should trust is hard!" 

My background is statistics with lots of side studies on economics having started a master. I have worked as a research assistant for a Brazilian National Research Institute, a statistician at Labour Ministry, Data Scientist at the largest media company in Latin America (Globo) and marketing scientist at Uber. My main area of interest are causal inference, econometrics and machine learning.

I'm driven by curiosity, challenging problems, chewing technical and academic books and seeing a problem from multiple perspectives. Code in R, Python, Spark, Hive and SQL.

Experience
============

I have been applying data analysis, analytics, experimentation, and machine learning professionally in the field of Web, Product and Marketing. Data-driven decision-making is key to organizations become more effectively and efficient attract, engage and retain customer.

#### @Uber

* Market Saturation, Total Addressable Market and Opportunity Size for Engagement, Churn and Acquisition segments
* Marketing and Incentives Impact in Acquisition Metrics - short and long term.
* LAtam POC for Marketing Incrementality Test & Measurement
* Offline and Brand Campaigns Business Impact
* Marketing Business Results Report sent monthly for key stakeholers
* Interviewing marketing data analysts
* Fraud Analysis Report

#### @Globo.com - largest media company in Latin America

* Daily business insights giving guidance for product changes (working along a software engineer and a designer)
* Implemented a churn prediction model to anticipate this decision and make actions to retain the customer.
* Building the metrics and the statistical environment on A/B platform.
* Formulating success metrics for quality of experience on player, estimating marginal effects of these metrics on engagement and using the estimates on how to prioritize what metric to act on.
* Computer Vision for predicting when the video credits start 

#### @Ministry of Labor

* Time series prediction of admissions and dismissals for the main Brazilian cities
* Monthly report of labor market monitoring metrics of affiliated municipalities
* Dashboard available online for anyone interested in the most current labor market situation

#### @IPEA - Institute of Economic and Applied Research

* An econometric analysis of the diversity on agriculture familiar production.
* Panel of social vulnerability in partnership with the UN.
* Investigates the population and employment dynamics in central urban areas of twelve selected capitals. Kernel heat maps were used to conceptualize and delimite central areas for each city.
