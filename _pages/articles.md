A list of must read articles that I read and thought was great ideia to share them. You will be able to find diverse subjects like machine learning, recommender systems, statistics, business and big data.


Business
============

### [Experimentation - Moving from a Culture of Deployment to a Culture of Learning](http://codevoyagers.com/2015/11/26/common-pitfalls-in-experimentation/)
by **Skyscanner** 
<br/>
<br/>
Through experiments we expose our ideas to empirical evaluation. Naturally, uncertainty follows, but the organisational mind-set one develops around this uncertainty is crucial.

### [Growth Cycle - Stepping Up Your A/B Tests](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2017/07/stepping-ab-tests/)
by **Kevin Shanahan: Peak**
<br/>
<br/>
Brainstorm, prioritise, define, implement, analyse and learn.
<br/>

### [Data Sciente - Key Skills and the Correct Mindset](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/academia-to-data-science-99e68f36485e)
by **Avneesh Saluja, Alok Gupta and Cuky Perez: Airbnb** 
<br/>
<br/>
Data Science is very much an overloaded term that sits at the intersection of Mathematics/Statistics, business domain knowledge, and ‘hacking’. Data Scientists are asked to extract insights from data to drive a company’s metrics. 

Creativity has to go into how to set up the problem in the first place, a fast-moving environment, premature optimization (80% of the way there), deliver bottom-line impact and talking the walk in a collaborative environment are some of the key things to look for in Data Scientists.

Machine Learning
============

### [Why Should I Trust You? - Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04938.pdf) 
by **Marco Tulio Ribeiro: University of Washington** 
<br/>
<br/>
Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one.

### [The History of Deep Learning - Explored Through 6 Code Snippets](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-history-of-deep-learning-explored-through-6-code-snippets-d0a0e8545202)
by **Emil Wallnér**
<br/>
<br/>
Six snippets of code that made deep learning what it is today. It covers the inventors and the background to their breakthroughs.

Statistics
============

### [Planning an A/B Test - How Sure and How Big](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/17/power-calculations-p-values-ab-testing-stack-overflow/)
by **Julia Silge: Stackoverflow**

<br/>
<br/>
A/B testing helps us gain confidence in the change we’re making. It helps us validate new ideas and guides decision making. How sure do we need to be that we are measuring a real change?
How big is the change we expect to see because of the new version, compared to the baseline?

### [Understanding A/B Tests Results ](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/experiments-at-airbnb-e2db3abf39e7)
by **Jan Overgoor: Airbnb**

<br/>
<br/>
Controlled experiments are a great way to inform decisions around product development. The best way to determine how long you should run an experiment is to compute the sample size you need to make an inference in advance.

It is important to consider results in context. Break them down into meaningful cohorts and try to deeply understand the impact of the change you made. In general, experiments should be run to make good decisions about how to improve the product, rather than to aggressively optimize for a metric. Optimizing is not impossible, but often leads to opportunistic decisions for short-term gains.
