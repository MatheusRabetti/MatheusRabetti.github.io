A list of must read articles that I read and thought was great ideia to share them. You will be able to find diverse subjects like machine learning, recommender systems, statistics, business and big data.


Business
============

### [Experimentation - moving from a culture of deployment to a culture of learning](http://codevoyagers.com/2015/11/26/common-pitfalls-in-experimentation/)
by **Skyscanner** 
<br/>
<br/>
Through experiments we expose our ideas to empirical evaluation. Naturally, uncertainty follows, but the organisational mind-set one develops around this uncertainty is crucial.

Machine Learning
============

### [Why Should I Trust You? - Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04938.pdf) 
by **Marco Tulio Ribeiro: University of Washington** 
<br/>
<br/>
Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one.
