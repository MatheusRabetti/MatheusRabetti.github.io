A list of must read articles that I read and thought was great ideia to share them. You will be able to find diverse subjects like machine learning, recommender systems, statistics, business and big data.


Business
============

### [Experimentation - moving from a culture of deployment to a culture of learning](http://codevoyagers.com/2015/11/26/common-pitfalls-in-experimentation/)
by **Skyscanner** 
<br/>
<br/>
Through experiments we expose our ideas to empirical evaluation. Naturally, uncertainty follows, but the organisational mind-set one develops around this uncertainty is crucial.

Machine Learning
============

### [Why Should I Trust You? - Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04938.pdf) 
by **Marco Tulio Ribeiro: University of Washington** 
<br/>
<br/>
Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one.

### [The History of Deep Learning - Explored Through 6 Code Snippets](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-history-of-deep-learning-explored-through-6-code-snippets-d0a0e8545202)
by **Emil Wallnér**
<br/>
<br/>
Six snippets of code that made deep learning what it is today. It covers the inventors and the background to their breakthroughs.

Statistics
============

### [Planning an A/B Test - How Sure and How Big](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/17/power-calculations-p-values-ab-testing-stack-overflow/)
by **Julia Silge: Stackoverflow**

<br/>
<br/>
A/B testing helps us gain confidence in the change we’re making. It helps us validate new ideas and guides decision making. How sure do we need to be that we are measuring a real change?
How big is the change we expect to see because of the new version, compared to the baseline?
