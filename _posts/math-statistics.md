# Hey, I'm a statistician

I call myself a statistician, because, well, I’m a statistics graduate student. 
However, ask me specific questions about hypothesis tests
or required sampling size, and my answer probably won’t be very good.

The other day I was trying to think of the last time I did an actual hypothesis test or formal analysis.
I couldn’t remember. I actually had to dig up old course listings to figure out when it was. 
It was four years ago during my first year of graduate school. I did well in those courses,
and I’m confident I could do that stuff with a quick refresher, but it’s a no go off the cuff.
It’s just not something I do regularly.

Instead, the most important things I’ve learned are less formal,
but have proven extremely useful when working/playing with data. Here they are in no particular order.


# Statistics is not math

“Here is a column of a couple of dozen numbers. From them, calculate the mean and standard deviation. 
When you are finished — it should take you a good fifteen to twenty minutes — report back to me.”

So goes the instruction in many, if not most or even all, undergraduate statistics courses across the land.
Running through endless examples of plugging numbers into calculators and pressing certain buttons.
So what if the students forget why they’ve done it?

This inertia is a quirk of human nature and is common in any field of instruction: its limitations are
overcome easily by all serious students. Far more restraining, however, are the pernicious effects of the belief
that statistics is a branch of mathematics.

Statistics is not math; neither is probability. It is true that math has proven unreasonably effective
in understanding statistics, but it is not, or at least not the sole, language to describe its workings. 

That language is philosophical. Just think: statistics self-named purpose is to compile evidence to use in quantifying 
uncertainty in (self-selected) hypotheses. How this evidence bears on the hypotheses may be best described mathematically,
but why it does so cannot be. It also cannot be that because statistics uses so much math that it is math. 

Statistics rightly belongs to epistemology, the philosophy of how we know what we know. 
Probability and statistics can even be called quantitative epistemology. 
Our axioms concern themselves with what probability means; that is, of the interpretation of uncertainty. 
But we abandon those axioms too quickly, choosing instead to follow the path of equations, 
nearly always skimping on what those equations actually mean. 

To master probability and statistics requires mastering a great chunk of math. But we begin to go wrong when we 
mindlessly apply equations in inappropriate situations because of the allure of quantification. Equations become a scapegoat!

Philosophy sharpens the mind. It teaches us to recognize and eliminate sloppy thinking and writing,
two elements rife in our field. 
If people spent more time thinking about what they are saying and doing, much error would be reduced or eliminated. 

I’ll give just one example. What is a confidence interval? It is an equation, of course, 
that will provide you an interval for your data. It is meant to provide a measure of the uncertainty of a parameter estimate. 
Now, strictly according to frequentist theory the only thing you can say about the CI
you have in hand is that the true value of the parameter lies within it or that it does not. 
This is a tautology, therefore it is always true. Thus, the CI provides no measure of uncertainty at all.

But ask your neighborhood statistician and you will hear words about “95% confidence”, about “long runs”, 
about “other experiments”, etc., etc. **These poorly chosen phrases are a bar to clear thinking**. 
They make the utterer forget that all he can say is some tautological, and therefore trivial, truth. 
He has concentrated on the math, making sure to divide by n minus one in the appropriate place, etc.,
and has not given any time to consider why the calculation exists.

The statistics fields is on check because of this kind of mindset. 
When elections starts and a president have 70% of probability of winning and he doesn't win people say the maths were wrong.
But they weren't! It's all right that it happens due to error and variability. 
All a statistician will say is - Repeat this a thousand of times and you will see that he would have won 70% of the time. 
This one time election can't be repeated!

Much nonsense in the last century has been promulgated because of sloppy thinking in statistics.
It is time to stop thinking about the mathematics and more on the meaning.
